# photomosaicbooth
sense of self project for desinv23.

photomosaic booth is a simple software to recreate photos using other photos. 

the html loads in 60 photos from the free picsum photos API online and sorts them by average hex code. when you click a picture, it analyzes each pixel for its average hex code, and swaps it with a photo from the API. thus, recreating your photo using other photos, creating a mosaic.

currently has 4 tile size options. UI is based in navy blue and has interactive photo booth. 

working on adding filters to the photo booth as well as having more image options (ie themed photos).
